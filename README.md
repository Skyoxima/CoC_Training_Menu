Hello everyone, here's my crown jewel (till date) project as an aspiring Front-end Developer: A fully functional implementation of the famous game Clash of Clan's in-game training menu.

I've played the game ever since its release (I was in grade 4, used to play it on my dad's phone, fond memoriesðŸ¥°) and have always loved the artstyle, the overall bright and sunshine-y aesthetic of it.

I also really really like its UI and that's what got me motivated to try recreating it as a web application. It also seemed like a perfect project to learn SvelteJS as I've heard a lot of good things about it, gotta say, it lives up to them!

I also didn't want to one-to-one replicate it as firstly to hone my originality/creativity which is a must for a front-end developer and secondly it wouldn't be possible on the web (not as easily at least haha).
To my jaw-dropping surprise, what I've created here is now somewhat similar to what the current 'info' tab for entities (troop, spell, sieges) looks like (as I had started this project in late August '23).

I want to give a big thank you to [Clash of Clans Fandom](https://clashofclans.fandom.com) for the detailed statistics of the entities. Of course, a big thanks to [Clash of Clans](https://supercell.com/en/games/clashofclans/) for making such an enjoyable game.
